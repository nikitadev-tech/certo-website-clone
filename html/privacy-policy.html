            <div class="basic-info__text">Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and
                remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables

                our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our

            <div class="basic-info__text">You have the right to ask us about the personal data we process about you, the purpose and nature of the processing, and to provide information on who we share it with. You have the right to request that we update, correct, delete (assuming
                that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) or export your data, as well as the right to object to processing and lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. You can exercise these rights by emailing us at privacy@certosoftware.com.
                Please note that we may reject or refuse to fulfil to the fullest extent requests which risk the privacy of others or are unreasonable or repetitive, or would require disproportionate effort.</div>
            <div class="basic-info__text">You have the right to opt-out of receiving certain emails (e.g., marketing communications) at any time by following the relevant unsubscribe process outlined in the applicable email. Please be aware that our emails may include important or

            <div class="basic-info__text">We do not log your browsing activity, DNS queries, or the content of your internet traffic when using the VPN. Limited diagnostic and performance data may be collected in an anonymized and non-identifiable form, solely for the purpose of maintaining

            <div class="basic-info__text">PureVPN does not have access to any personally identifiable information about you, and it is contractually prohibited from using or storing any data for its own purposes. All data processed via the VPN is encrypted and handled in compliance

            <div class="basic-info__text">We do not share VPN usage data with third parties except where required by law, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise monetize your VPN activity in any way.</div>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
            <div class="basic-info__text">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably
                the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom
                it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</div>
            <div class="basic-info__text">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</div>
            <ul class="basic-info__ul">
                <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
                <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
                <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="basic-info__text">Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</div>
            <ul class="basic-info__ul">
                <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="basic-info__text">Users are able to change their personal information:</div>
            <ul class="basic-info__ul">
                <li>By emailing us</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>
            <div class="basic-info__text">We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</div>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h2>
            <div class="basic-info__text">It’s also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking</div>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
            <div class="basic-info__text">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the
                COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</div>
            <div class="basic-info__text">We do not specifically market to children under 13.</div>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">Fair Information Practices</h2>
            <div class="basic-info__text">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</div>
            <div class="basic-info__text">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</div>
            <div class="basic-info__text">We will notify the users via email</div>
            <ul class="basic-info__ul">
                <li>Within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="basic-info__text">We will notify the users via in site notification</div>
            <ul class="basic-info__ul">
                <li>Within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="basic-info__text">We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
                individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">CAN SPAM Act</h2>
            <div class="basic-info__text">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</div>
            <div class="basic-info__text">If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</div>
            <h2 class="basic-info__h2">Contacting Us</h2>
